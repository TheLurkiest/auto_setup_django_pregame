# auto_setup_django_pregame


For set up we create a basic little 2 step domino push, causing the shell script we've
created to run our python3 module when we execute it.

Make sure to use chmod +x django_auto_shotgun_pregame.sh in order get permissions
to execute if you dont have them already.



Once we've got our python module up and running we start prompting the user to give us
info on the models he wants to create and the fields within those models.  We don't have
much in terms of detailed options for our initial setup but hopefully that'll change with
time-- but right now you only get one model at setup.


Now that we have prompted the user and gotten the user we wanted we will rush
through the first 4 steps of django rest api setup with a bunch of generic
placeholder
